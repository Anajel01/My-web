                <h4 >So...who am I?</h4>
                <h6>When initially choosing course of my studies, I believed that a career in hotel management was a right thing for me to do. However, after four years in the field I began noticing that my interests and passion shifted more towards graphic design rather than managing hotels and restaurants. This revelation prompted me to go a different path in life, and upon completing my hotel management studies in Croatia, I decided to move to Denmark and enrol into a multimedia design course at EASV. </h6>
                <h6>At first, attending the class as someone completely new to multimedia design was a challenge, especially 0safter seeing how most of my classmates already had years of prior experience in this field. Yet, this difference in the level of expertise became an opportunity to quicky learn and catch up to others rather than a setback. </h6>
                <h6>Each one of my accomplishments became a proof of both flexibility and resilience of which I was capable, and due to that this never-ending process of growth continues to be the foundation of my motivation, driving me onward as I continue to improve in the ever-changing field of multimedia design.</h6>
